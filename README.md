A) Marketing Insights:

1) Rewarding Most Loyal Users:
   Task: Find the 5 oldest users of Instagram.
   Response: To find the 5 oldest users, we need to sort the user database by their sign-up date in ascending order and select the top 5 users with the earliest registration dates.

2) Remind Inactive Users to Start Posting:
   Task: Find users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.
   Response: To identify such users, we need to filter the database for users who have never uploaded any photos or whose photo count is zero.

3) Declaring Contest Winner:
   Task: Identify the winner of the contest with the most likes on a single photo.
   Response: We'll need to analyze the contest data to find the user with the photo that received the highest number of likes. This user can be declared as the winner.

4) Hashtag Researching:
   Task: Identify and suggest the top 5 most commonly used hashtags on the platform.
   Response: We'll need to analyze the hashtags used in posts and select the top 5 that appear most frequently across the platform.

5) Launch AD Campaign:
   Task: Determine the best day to launch ADs by identifying the day of the week when most users register.
   Response: We should analyze user registration data to find the day of the week with the highest registration rate, indicating the best day to schedule an ad campaign.

B) Investor Metrics:

6) User Engagement:
   Task: Provide the average user's post frequency and the total number of photos on Instagram per user.
   Response: We'll calculate the average number of posts per user by dividing the total number of photos by the total number of users.

7) Bots & Fake Accounts:
   Task: Provide data on users (bots) who have liked every single photo on the site.
   Response: Identify and summarize the number of users who have liked every single photo, which is likely abnormal behavior and could indicate potential bot or fake accounts.
